    Hello! My name is Leo Friedman and I have always been fascinated by technology and its ability to shape our world, which is what led me to pursue a career in this field.

I am currently in my third year of studies and have gained a strong foundation in programming languages such as C++, Java, C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Python. I tend to prefer working on the back-end of projects but I am versatile and can help out on the front-end as needed.</h2>
<h2 class="description">I am always eager to learn and improve my skills, and I am constantly seeking out new challenges to push myself further. What sets me apart from others is my strong work ethic and attention to detail. I firmly believe in doing a job right, rather than simply getting it done quickly. I am constantly striving for excellence and take pride in my ability to deliver high-quality work.
In addition to my technical skills, I am also a great team player. I enjoy collaborating with others and believe that the best results come from working together towards a common goal. I am also highly adaptable and able to handle changing priorities and deadlines with ease.</h2>
<h2 class="description">Outside of my studies, I am actively involved in extracurricular activities such as serving as the Academic Chairman for the Epsilon Mu Chapter of Sigma Nu as well as being an active member of the Butler Association for Computing Machinery. These experiences have not only helped me to further develop my skills, but have also taught me the importance of creativity and thinking outside the box to ensure I am carrying out my role in an effective manner.</h2>
